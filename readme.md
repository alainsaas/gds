This repository contains the website of [the Call for Papers on Game Data Science at IEEE/ACM DSAA 2016](http://gamedatascience.org/).

It seems to be the right template for minimalist call for papers websites and has been reused by [DS4ADSS 2016](https://www.iiit.ac.in/DS4ADSS/) and [BBDA 2016](http://www.meng-jiang.com/bbda-dsaa16/).

You can reuse this template as well, but if possible please let me know. Also, don't forget to change the Google Analytics id.

The _content_ folder contains the page structure and a text file explaining how to generate the content from a markdown file.
