This repository contains the website of [the Call for Papers on Game Data Science at IEEE/ACM DSAA 2016](http://gamedatascience.org/) that I am co-organizing.

It seems to be the right template for minimalist call for papers websites, and at least [one other CFP reused it](https://www.iiit.ac.in/DS4ADSS/).

Feel free to reuse this template as well, but if possible just let me know.  
The _content_ folder contains the page structure and a text file explaing how to generate the content from a markdown file.
