###ACM/IEEE DSAA 2016
##Call for Papers for a Special Session on
##**Game Data Science (GDS 2016)**

### Aims and Scope
In the past years, both traditional video game platforms and emerging mobile games have tended to become always connected to the Internet. This allows game developers to collect a huge amount of data in real time while maintaining an active relationship with the players. This recent revolution of the video-game industry creates a broad range of new challenges for both research and business applications. The current trend to include social features and in-app purchases to games, combined with the exceptional level of granularity of the data collected makes game datasets a unique source of information to observe and analyze human behavior, including social and consumer dynamics.

It is paramount that research efforts focus on the development of adequate statistical and learning methods able to model and predict player behavior, that scale to big datasets and allow an intuitive visualization of the results.

In this special session on Game Data Science we aim to bring together experts from research and industry, providing a stimulating atmosphere to promote collaborations and mutual exchange. The goal of the GDS session is to gather outstanding contributions, pursuing the development and application of new technologies towards a new paradigm in video-games. This special session calls for work on data science that help to understand and predict player behavior, addressing this challenge from three points of view: the statistical/machine learning methodology, visualization analysis and data science product deployment.

### Topics of Interest
